# MRLR - My Rust Learning Roadmap
This is my very own roadmap to learning Rust. ðŸ¦€

It's not perfect, of course, but it's focused towards into what *I want* to learn and do within it.

Also, this repository will always a WIP, and I'm going to add, change or even remove stuf since my interests can and will change during these studies. If I remove something from my "todo list", it's not that I gave up, it's just that I don't think that this makes sense. If you're more experienced and want to help in some way, feel free to make some kind of code review or disclaimer here, I'll appreciate that :).

And to end this section, this project is public just to share my learning process. It's not meant to be used for others to learn. Probably one day I end up closing this repo and archiving it.

### Structure
`books/` - it's what I'm doing right now, based on the [rust programming language book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

### Goals

*studying*
- [ ] Finish [the official book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) in my spare time;
- [ ] Study the [standard library](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html);
- [ ] Take some closer look into [cargo book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html);
- [ ] [rustc book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/index.html)
- [ ] [rustdoc book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/index.html);
- [ ] an overall of contents in the contents of the repo linked at references;

*hands on*
- [ ] make a simple snake-like game project using either [rust-sdl2](https://github.com/Rust-SDL2/rust-sdl2) or [amethyst](https://amethyst.rs/), based on how difficult it gets to achieve;
- [ ] [vulkan-tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) to learn by studying binding vulkan api directly on rust
- [ ] create a small framework to help making game prototypes, with the basics:
  - [ ] graphics rendering
  - [ ] sounds
  - [ ] simple math library (my own, without any complex crate)
  - [ ] basic AABB collisions
- [ ] start contributing (as I get confidence to that) in existing crates and projects (not necessarily gamedev related)
